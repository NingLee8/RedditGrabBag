### Deliberate Choices

#### Blood Money

Does not trigger on gold gained with Bloody Idol.

(Whenever you lose HP, gain gold. Whenever you gain gold, heal 5 HP)

#### Bottomless Bottle (relic)

Ignores the following potions to avoid fatal turn 1 scenarios:

* Fairy in a Bottle
* Distilled Chaos
* Snecko Oil
* Smoke Bomb

#### Kusamibaru (relic)

Does not trigger when Block and Incoming Damage is 0.

#### Sap (card)

Player does not gain strength if the effect is blocked by Artifact.

#### Singularity (card)

Upgrade text removes the word "Exhausted" from the description in order to fit all text on the card within 5 line limit.

#### Silk Scarf & Shepherd's Crook

Originally designed as Power cards but reworked as relics

### Known Issues

#### Cursed Dagger (relic)
Fight does not stop if dagger is the only enemy left (It is YOUR minion)

Dagger will always trigger on the right side of the fight during Shield and Spear fight.

The dagger position is ignored when determined the existence of the Surrounded! effect.

Possibly in need of a buff (extra energy on the turn dagger spawns?)

3 energy/3 turns for Incoming 9+25 damage + 1 Wound or redirect 20 damage
